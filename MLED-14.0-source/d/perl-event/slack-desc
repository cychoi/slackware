perl-event: perl-event (Event loop processing)
perl-event:
perl-event: The Event module provide a central facility to watch for various 
perl-event: types of events and invoke a callback when these events occur. The 
perl-event: idea is to delay the handling of events so that they may be 
perl-event: dispatched in priority order when it is safe for callbacks to 
perl-event: execute.
